built with vue & deno. install nodejs & deno first, then get into the folder via commandline & run `npm i`. when that's done go to the `serve` folder & run that again.
once that's done, go back & run `deno task sdev`, open another commandline window, and `deno task dev`. hopefully everything "works"
