Bugs:
    [1] host card view (Noble.vue > CountryCollection.vue > GenericPanel.vue) only fetches files when selecting another game
        [1.1] player selection is entirely unresponsive
        [1.2] once game and turn are selected, view doesn't auto-select (or at least prompt to select) a player
            - note: the combination of those two effectively means bophost would need to select a game _and then_ select another. which is needless to say entirely *wrong*
    [2] hosts don't see fetch files in their view; it does fetch them correctly though... at least i _think_ it does
        - note: it does send the request and recieve appropriate files. yay.
        - note 2: logging out from host acc & then logging into player acc without reloading page may also fuck up player view (MainFrame.vue > CountryCollection.vue > GenericPanel.vue) into not reflecting fetches. probably snafu'd variables and cache'd views, though who knows. see if it solves itself after main bug's done :iamamoron:
    [3] hosts fetch in new bop out of order: 3 files, then bop info, then boppeople list
    [4] hosts fetch boppeople twice. possibly watcher in particular view being weird (so i may have written the effect twice or made it depend on two things somehow. oops)

Features:
    [1] make editor usable
        [1.1] Actually Implement Saving The Damn Files lol
        [1.2] make editor/result view single element. somehow
    [2] admin panel; that is, account creation, so i don't have to do three hashes and a half from "memory"
    [3] reduced-motion accessibility
    [4] should probably add some haptics to the button so user knows request was sent out. perchance some ref that gets mutated on-click and then back once the login fetch is done
        [4.1] and also to bop fetchment. again probably ref flags or a whole reactive

Delayed until further notice:
    [] single-port server
        -- running on :800 & :80. once front (everything inside src) is built, will have to create extra functions for serving those assets (whatever js+css files vite generates & the main index.js ofc) and the default 404/403

Fixed/implemented:
    - logins work
    - player can read cards per bop per turn
    - database access keys are no longer public info ha ha
    - dark/lightmode
    - sidebar that _does_ go away
    - "real-time" (see feature req. 1) bbcode edition
    - bop change no longer auto-defaults fetch to privilege lvl 3 (host)
