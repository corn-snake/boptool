Delayed until further notice:
    [?] single-port server
        -- running on :800 & :80. once front (everything inside src) is built, will have to create extra functions for serving those assets (whatever js+css files vite generates & the main index.js ofc) and the default 404/403
        --- currently front proxies into back
    [1] style bottom left corner for resizer

Fixed/implemented:
    - logins work
    - player can read cards per bop per turn
    - database access keys are no longer public info ha ha
    - dark/lightmode
    - sidebar that _does_ go away
    - bop change no longer auto-defaults fetch to privilege lvl 3 (host)
    - hosts fetch bop, then boppeople
    - all views fetch files as necessary
