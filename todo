focus: F[1], B[1]

Features:
    [1] make editor usable
        [1.1] Actually Implement Saving The Damn Files lol
        [1.2] make editor/result view single element. somehow
    [2] admin panel; that is, account creation, so i don't have to do three hashes and a half from "memory"
    [3] reduced-motion accessibility
    [4] should probably add some haptics to the button so user knows request was sent out. perchance some ref that gets mutated on-click and then back once the login fetch is done
        [4.1] and also to bop fetchment. again probably ref flags or a whole reactive
    [5] notes
    [6] small screen queries
    [7] in-code comments (// token will stop stuff in front of it from displaying, /* */ tkn pairs constitute block-level comments)

FRs:
    [1] preview
        [1.1] markdown/bbcode switch
    [2] all small
        [2.1] any small
    [3] thing to make sure edit conflicts show up
    [4]

Delayed until further notice:
    [] single-port server
        -- running on :800 & :80. once front (everything inside src) is built, will have to create extra functions for serving those assets (whatever js+css files vite generates & the main index.js ofc) and the default 404/403

Fixed/implemented:
    - logins work
    - player can read cards per bop per turn
    - database access keys are no longer public info ha ha
    - dark/lightmode
    - sidebar that _does_ go away
    - bop change no longer auto-defaults fetch to privilege lvl 3 (host)
    - hosts fetch bop, then boppeople
    - all views fetch files as necessary
    - data is stored and used appropriately (ideally you could make server check latest turn priv etc but i'm working on tight resources here)
    - loading/select haptics
    - slides up-down
